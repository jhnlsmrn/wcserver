      <h2><a href="#">History Was Made</a></h2>
      <p>Starship Entertainment has released a statement regarding the investigation into former MONSTA X member Wonho on charges of marijuana use in 2013. During the investigation, we minimized the media coverage and external exposure of Wonho as much as possible, and we have waited a long time as we did our best, such as appointing legal representation, to ensure that there were no unjust charges. We will give Wonho our full support so that he can continue down the path he desires in the future.</p>
